The hot springs of Altyn-Arashan are also widely known. They are located at a record height of 2,600 meters and have a healing effect due to the content of radon and hydrogen sulfide in the water, maintaining a high temperature all year round: 35 degrees for a radon source and 41 degrees for a hydrogen sulfide source.

To replenish his harem, he collected the most beautiful girls from all over the Tien Shan. Their immeasurable suffering from the cruelty of their husband pitied the mountains. The place where the khan's palace stood sank, and the water flooded the ruler's headquarters with the adjacent territory. And so this amazing lake was formed, which absorbed all the beauty of those women who were in captivity of the khan.",
